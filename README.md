## LMU DS Practical project in collaboration with BMW

The **goal** of the project is to create a model, that will read human written text, create a summary for it and classify it according to defined classes

Repository contains 6 Files:
* *Current README* 
* *Report* \
Contains information on the workflow, conducted research and model performance analysis
* *Presentation* \
The presentation of the project, holding information from the report in the presenting suitable form
* *RoBERTa* \
Contains the code to the first-choice model for summarization, that was abandoned (c.f. Report / Model Choice), however can be working after fina-tuning
* *T5summarization* \
Contains the code of the second-choice model (Google T5) for summarization, that was set as a primar model and is supposed to be the solution of the summarization task.
* *Classification* \
Contains the code of the classification model, using DistilBERT and is supposed to be the solution of the classification task.
