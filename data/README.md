The "data" folder contains the description and the data files used in both summarization and classification models.

The dataset that is used as the input for the **T5 Summarization model** and the **Classification model** is the Amazon Product Review dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).
It is a publicly available dataset which contains 568.454 reviews. The data is stored within 10 columns: _Id_, _ProductId_, _UserId_, _ProfileName_, _HelpfulnessNumerator_, _HelpfulnessDenominator_, _Score_, _Time_, _Summary_, and _Text_.

First, while reading the data in both models the unnecessary columns are deleted ('Id', 'ProductId', 'UserId', 'ProfileName', 'HelpfulnessNumerator','HelpfulnessDenominator', 'Score', 'Time'). Thereafter, all entries without any values are removed as well. That cleans the dataset up to 568.427 reviews.

Additionally, **Classification model** requires further input after the training is completed: the CSV-file _"summary_test.csv"_ (available in the current folder), which is generated by the T5 summarization model and contains generated summaries. These summaries are the ones being classified at the end of the process.

Due to the lack of computational resources to perform the T5-summarization on the full dataset, the current version of the _"summary_test.csv"_ contains a sample of 100.000 entries.
