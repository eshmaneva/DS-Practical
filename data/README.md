The "data" folder contains the description and the data files used in both summarization and classification models.

The dataset that is used as the input for the **T5 Summarization model** and the **Classification model** is the Amazon Product Review dataset, that is avaliable on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).
It is a publicly available dataset, which contains 568.454 reviews. The data is stored within 10 columns: _Id_, _ProductId_, _UserId_, _ProfileName_, _HelpfulnessNumerator_, _HelpfulnessDenominator_, _Score_, _Time_, _Summary_, and _Text_.

First, while reading the data in both models the unnecessar columns are deleted ('Id', 'ProductId', 'UserId', 'ProfileName', 'HelpfulnessNumerator','HelpfulnessDenominator', 'Score', 'Time'). Thereafter all entries without any values are removed as well. That cleans the dataset up to 568.427 reviews.

Additionally, **Classification model** requires the further input after the training is completed: the csv-file _"summary_test.csv"_, that is generated by T5 summarization model and contains generated summaries. These summaries are the ones being classified in the end of the process.

Due to the lack of computational resources to perform the T5-summarization on the full dataset, current version of the _"summary_test.csv"_ contains the sample of 100.000 entries.
